Mangrove forests are coastal ecosystems found in tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by salt-tolerant trees and shrubs 
known as mangroves. These forests are typically found along sheltered shorelines, where the land meets the sea, in areas with high 
tidal influence. Mangroves are unique because they thrive in brackish water, where freshwater meets seawater, and are well-adapted 
to withstand harsh conditions such as saltwater, strong waves, and anoxic (low oxygen) soils. Mangrove trees have specialized root 
systems, such as prop roots and pneumatophores, that allow them to stay anchored in soft, waterlogged soil while also obtaining oxygen.
